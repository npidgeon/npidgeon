- 👋 Hi, I’m @npidgeon
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, AWS, and programming languages that are primarily used in the AWS infrastructure. I've been self-studying through platforms like freecodecamp, Codecademy, The Odin Project, and Pluralsight to build a strong foundation, and may be pursuing an online MSCS in the near future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, and Go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any intermediate level projects to build my Git portfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me ... npidgeon97 @ gmail . com
